quartoYAAC provides a convenience function for adding the [quarto-yaac](https://github.com/mps9506/quarto-yaac) template to your current R project. It also includes several functions that converts data frames to the .tex used by the underlying document document class.

## Installation

You can install the development version of quartoYAAC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mps9506/quartoYAAC")
```


## Use

### Template

To add the template to your current R project:

```r
library(quartoYAAC)
use_quarto_yaac(file_name = "My_CV")
```

If you are in an interactive session, the .qmd file will open. 

### Headings

Specify section headings using H1 (`#`) and adding the `.sectiontitle` class. To include a formatted fontawesome icon in the heading include the `.faIcon` class as the second class (replacing "Icon" with the desired icon name). For example:

```
# Experience {.sectiontitle .faSuitcase}
```

See [the fontawesome5 Latex package documentation](https://mirrors.mit.edu/CTAN/fonts/fontawesome5/doc/fontawesome5.pdf) for a full list of FontAwesome icons and names that can be used in this template.

 - `print_experience_block()`: formatted work experience section
 - `print_education_block()`: formatted education section
